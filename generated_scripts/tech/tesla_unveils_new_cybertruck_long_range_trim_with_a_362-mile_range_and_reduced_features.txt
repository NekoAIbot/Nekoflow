The original script:

"Tesla unveils the newest generation of electric cargo trucks that will offer longer endurance and more features than ever before..."

The idea of Tesla’s electric trucks was born from the desire to reduce the mass of current diesels, which have a high amount of drag that increase transmission losses. This new generation of trucks are being introduced to the market in order to reduce vehicular emissions and improve fuel efficiency.

The Tesla CTS-VSE will have a range of 378 miles at a top speed of 37 mph and will be equipped with a six-speed manual transmission. Tesla also claims that the CTS-VSE will achieve a fuel efficiency of 36 miles per gallon.

The Tesla CTS-VSE will be the company’s first truck with a self-driving system that will be programmed to change lanes and avoid obstacles. Users will be able to control a vehicle with Google’s CarPlay, Apple’s CarPlay or the Tesla Dashboard. Developers will also have access to Tesla’s Autopilot and DeepFlex driving modes for autonomous driving.

The Tesla will be unveiled at the upcoming Performance Road America.

The Tesla CTS-VSE will be available in the United States in December 2018, and will also be available in Europe and Asia in 2019. The Tesla CTS-VSE will be the first electric cargo truck in the United States.

Tesla currently has a technology patent on the electric trucks, which we have posted on our patent page.

We hope the Tesla CTS-VSE will be the world’s first electric cargo truck and will help people to reduce their carbon footprint.
