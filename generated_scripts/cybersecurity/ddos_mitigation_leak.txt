The following script was given to me by the owner of this account. I modified it to be more generic and gave it to another guy who previously had an initial version of the same script.

The points are:

1. DDoS is a massive attack against a victim network. We never want to hear that.
2. DDoS attacks are characterized by large bursts of traffic. The bigger the burst, the more difficult it is to detect the attack.
3. The more traffic that a network accepts, the greater the DDoS attack.
4. The attack works best if the victim is password protected..
5. Because of the attack traffic, many systems are always vulnerable.
6. Attackers can use encryption to hide the victim's network.
7. Cyber criminals use brute force attacks to attack systems in order to break their encryption.
8. We have no way of knowing if a DDoS attack was successful or failed.

The result of the script is that you can put this video title on all your own commercial videos, as well as on websites.

It's a lot harder to break the encryption of a DDoS attack than it is to break it for a standard server.

One thing that I would add is that you do not want to use a super high quality image. It makes it harder to detect the attack.
