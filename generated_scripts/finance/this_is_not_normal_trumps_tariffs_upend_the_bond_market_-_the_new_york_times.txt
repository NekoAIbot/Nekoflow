[New] “This is Not Normal — Trump’s Tariffs Upend the Bond Market”

The New York Times on Thursday reported that the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve will probably not be able to sustain their standoff until Congress approves a package of new tariffs to address the border security concerns of President Trump.

The tariffs, which are expected to generate $19 billion in retaliation, are also part of a larger package of trade restrictions that Trump has imposed on China in response to the tech giant’s theft of intellectual property.

Trump’s actions “sound the alarms” about the threat of trade tariffs, Politico reported at the time.
