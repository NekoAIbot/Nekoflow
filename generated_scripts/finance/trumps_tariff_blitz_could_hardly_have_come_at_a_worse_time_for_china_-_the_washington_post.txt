Commentary

We all know that tariffs are bad on both sides of the trade table. You’ve probably heard it a lot during the Trump admin. Those tariffs have created a lot of anti-China sentiment. And these tariffs may be coming back to bite you.

And this certification is what is keeping this trade war going. So it makes sense to take these export certifications into account.
