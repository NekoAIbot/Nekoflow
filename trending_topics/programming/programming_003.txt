In 2009, Colorado began offering teens free IUD's without parental consent. Teen pregnancy fell by 54%. Teen abortions fell by 64%. For every $1 spent on the program, CO saved nearly $6 on labor & delivery, child care & food stamps. This is how to reduce abortions. Pro life voters should take note. (Reddit)
